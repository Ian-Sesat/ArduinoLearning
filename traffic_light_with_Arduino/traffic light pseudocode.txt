The traffic light pseudoCode:
1. The pins for the LEDs(green, yellow and red) are declared so that they show to which pin they are connected in the arduino board
2. The LEDs are set as OUTPUT
3. The functions lighting the RED led, green LED, yellow LED are made
 For the red LED the following conditions are met: the red LED is turned ON and the yellow LED is turned OFF and the green LED is turned OFF.
 For the yellow LED the following conditions are met: the red LED is turned OFF and  the yellow LED is turned ON and the green LED is turned OFF.
 For the green LED the following conditions are met: the red LED is turned OFF and the yellow LED is turned OFF and the green LED is turned ON.
 The functions make use of the AND gate logic gate
4. In the loop function which executes always, the red LED is turned ON for a certain period of time , say 1 second followed by turning ON of the green LED for that set period of time and then the yellow LED is also turned ON for the same 
of time. These steps are performed repetitively which replicate the traffic light system.
